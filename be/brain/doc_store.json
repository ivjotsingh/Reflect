Sing the last note fully, make the\r\nlast letter of your name complete. Eat the last morsel deliberately. In\r\na real man's life there are no trifles. Whatever is worth doing by him\r\nis worth doing well. The many-sided Edward Everett attributed his being\r\nable to do so many things well to his early habit of doing even the\r\nleast thing thoroughly.

The man is somebody only when the fight\r\nis won within himself. Without the schools men have often reached the\r\npinnacles of success, through their own individual earnestness and\r\nenergy. Schools make wise men wiser, but they may make fools greater\r\nfools than ever. If colleges have fallen somewhat into disrepute, it is\r\nlargely due to the fact that we may have sent more fools than wise men\r\nto college. Many a man has been the better for being too poor to attend\r\nschool, like Franklin, Lincoln, Peter Cooper, and ten thousand other\r\nAmericans. Their thirst for what books had to give them forced them to\r\nwork harder and to deny themselves all the enjoyments that so vulgarize\r\nyet so charm the cheaper brood.\r\n\r\nAll that is won by sacrifice and downright hard work is priceless, and\r\n","metadata":{"source":"/Users/bluestacks/Desktop/ReflectAI/be/brain/pg36898.txt","fileName":"pg36898.txt","type":"text","parentId":"pg36898.txt","chunkIndex":68}},"68":{"id":"pg36898.txt_chunk_69","text":"hem forced them to\r\nwork harder and to deny themselves all the enjoyments that so vulgarize\r\nyet so charm the cheaper brood.\r\n\r\nAll that is won by sacrifice and downright hard work is priceless, and\r\nmany noble men and women who have risen to high honor and station owe\r\ntheir place and power solely to this. Be always mindful that power is\r\nthe only safe foundation for reputation. Thoughtful Americans are not\r\nconcerning themselves about who your ancestors were, and whether or not\r\nthey were graduated from some college. Like Doctor Holmes, they feel\r\nthat old families and old trees generally have their best parts\r\nunderground, and that the only progressive is the man who is bigger in\r\nthought and feeling and accomplishment than his father was.
