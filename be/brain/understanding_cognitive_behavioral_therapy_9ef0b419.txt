Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapeutic treatment that helps people learn how to identify and change destructive or disturbing thought patterns that have a negative influence on behavior and emotions.

CBT is grounded in the idea that our thoughts, not external events, affect the way we feel. In other words, it's not the situation you're in that determines how you feel, but your perception of the situation.

Key principles of CBT include:

1. Psychological problems are based, in part, on faulty or unhelpful ways of thinking.
2. Psychological problems are based, in part, on learned patterns of unhelpful behavior.
3. People suffering from psychological problems can learn better ways of coping with them, thereby relieving their symptoms and becoming more effective in their lives.

CBT treatment usually involves efforts to change thinking patterns. These strategies might include:
- Learning to recognize one's distortions in thinking that are creating problems
- Developing a greater sense of confidence in one's own abilities
- Facing one's fears instead of avoiding them
- Using problem-solving skills to cope with difficult situations
- Learning to calm one's mind and relax one's body

CBT has been demonstrated to be effective for a range of problems including depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol and drug use problems, marital problems, eating disorders, and severe mental illness.

The highly structured nature of CBT means it can be provided in different formats, including in groups, self-help books and apps. CBT techniques can also be incorporated into other therapeutic approaches.
