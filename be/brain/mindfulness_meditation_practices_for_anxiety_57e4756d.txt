Mindfulness meditation is a mental training practice that teaches you to slow down racing thoughts, let go of negativity, and calm both your mind and body. It combines meditation with the practice of mindfulness, which is being aware "in the moment."

There are various mindfulness techniques that can help reduce anxiety:

1. Basic Mindfulness Meditation: Find a quiet place, sit comfortably, focus on your breathing, and when your attention wanders, return.

2. Body Scan: Focus your attention on different parts of your body, from your toes to the top of your head.

3. Sitting Meditation: Sit comfortably with your back straight, focus on your breathing, and expand your awareness.

4. Walking Meditation: Find a quiet place to walk, focus on the experience of walking, the sensation of your feet touching the ground.

5. Mindful Eating: Pay attention to the taste, sight, textures, and smells of your food.

Research has shown mindfulness to be effective for reducing anxiety. It works by:
- Reducing rumination (dwelling on negative thoughts)
- Reducing stress
- Boosting working memory
- Improving focus
- Reducing emotional reactivity
- Increasing cognitive flexibility
- Enhancing relationship satisfaction

When practiced regularly, mindfulness meditation can help you train your brain to dismiss anxious thoughts when they arise. This practice creates space between your worried thoughts and actions, allowing you to react more calmly.
