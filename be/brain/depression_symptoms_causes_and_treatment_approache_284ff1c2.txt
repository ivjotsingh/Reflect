Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home.

Symptoms of depression can include:
- Feeling sad or having a depressed mood
- Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed
- Changes in appetite â€” weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting
- Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much
- Loss of energy or increased fatigue
- Increase in purposeless physical activity or slowed movements or speech
- Feeling worthless or guilty
- Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions
- Thoughts of death or suicide

Depression is caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Risk factors include:
- Personal or family history of depression
- Major life changes, trauma, or stress
- Certain physical illnesses and medications

Treatment for depression includes:

1. Psychotherapy: Cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, and other talk therapies can help people with depression.

2. Medication: Antidepressants are medicines that treat depression. They may help improve the way your brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress.

3. Self-help and coping strategies: Getting regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, avoiding alcohol and drugs, and reaching out to friends and family can all help manage depression.

4. ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy): This medical treatment is most commonly used for patients with severe major depression who have not responded to other treatments.

5. TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation): A noninvasive procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to improve symptoms of depression.

If you think you may have depression, talk to your healthcare provider as soon as possible. Depression is a serious condition requiring professional care and treatment.
